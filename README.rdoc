=ccnet.git.plugin

Source Control Plugin for CruiseControl.NET that talks to git.
Kinda Out of Date Documentation.

==configuration

===minimal ccnet configuration

  <sourcecontrol type="git">
        <repository>git@github.com:dogeth/ccnet.git.plugin.git</repository>
  </sourcecontrol>

===fully specified ccnet configuration

  <sourcecontrol type="git">
        <repository>git@github.com:dogeth/ccnet.git.plugin.git</repository>
        <branch>master</branch>
        <autoGetSource>true</autoGetSource>
        <executable>git</executable>
        <tagOnSuccess>false</tagOnSuccess>
        <tagCommitMessage>ccnet build {0}</tagCommitMessage>
        <workingDirectory>c:\build\ccnet.git.plugin</workingDirectory>
        <timeout>60000</timeout>
  </sourcecontrol>

==Environment
Before even attempting to use this plugin, take note of the following
* Your path should include %ProgramFiles%\Git\bin and %ProgramFiles%\Git\cmd
* The HOME environment variable should be set to %USERPROFILE%
* You should be able to run git from a standard command prompt.  

==Things to do
* I'm not checking for multiple heads, like the mercurial source control class.  Didn't see that situation arising in our current git workflow so I didn't bother.
* The position of each modification in the list is used as the ChangeNumber.  WHen 1.5 comes around may be able to use the commit hash instead.
* The type of modification is used to store the commit hash.  Should expand this to actual file information.
* Commit level modifications are used.  Actual files changed in each commit are not published.  Obviously something which could be implemented but have run out of time for the moment.
  
==Credits
I took a lot of ideas from the following
* http://jira.public.thoughtworks.org/browse/CCNET-1188
* http://www.codeplex.com/TFSCCNetPlugin/
* ccnet source

I also got some great feedback from Xerxes Battiwalla, see his blog post on the matter at http://www.xerxesb.com/2009/getting-cruisecontrolnet-to-talk-to-git/
